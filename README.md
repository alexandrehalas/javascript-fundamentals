# Javascript Fundamentals

## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

high-level because we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.

object-oriented because it's mostly based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data.

multi-paradigm language meaning it's so flexible and versatile that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming.
